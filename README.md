# Airline Customer Segmentation Based on LRFMC Model

## Introduction

This is an unsupervised machine learning practice on customer segmentation. I used LRFMC Model that is commonly used in aviation dataset. LRMFC stands for Length, Recency, Frequency, Monetary and Discount Factor. The details of each parameter is elaborated below:
1. Length: the length of days between subscriber's first register day to observation time. A larger number means they have been a member for a longer time
2. Recency: the length of a passenger's last consumption to observation window. A smaller number means they flew more recently
3. Frequency: the passenger's consumption frequency within a certain period of time. A bigger number means they flew more frequently
4. Monetary the average amount spent over a certain period of time. A bigger number means they spent more money
5. Discount Factor: the average space discount factor for passengers traveling within a certain period of time A bigger number means they use discounts more
K-means clustering method is used to classify the customer segmentation.

## Objective
To identify the customer segmentation in aviation company, analyze characteristics of different clusters and suggest business strategy to customer categories of different values.
